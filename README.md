This is a Virtual Reality arcade game in the space. I thought it would be fun to have an arcade-style game in the space so I created one. The uniqueness of this game is users can fly to move to different activities. There are 3 activities (games) at the moment.1: Punching exercise machine2: Ring launcher
3: Archery TargetYou can move back and forth using the HandJet to fly around those games.
